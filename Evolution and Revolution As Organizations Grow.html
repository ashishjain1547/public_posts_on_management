<p>Evolution and Revolution as Organizations Grow</p>
<p>Larry E. Greiner of the Harvard Business School wrote a noteworthy article
    with this title in the Harvard Business Review in July 1972, describing the
    growing pains that organizations go through.
</p>
<p>
    Greiner proposed that organizations exhibit five predictable stages of
    growth called evolutions and five periods of crises called revolutions. His
    theory is readily applicable to many organizations.</p>
<p>The growth pattern consists of tightening and loosening of management
    reins in response to changes within the organization and the environment.</p>
<p>The evolution/revolution pattern, as shown by Apple Computer, is an
    excellent way to put a company’s history into MBA perspective. Apple
    Computer sprang forth from the creativity of Steven Jobs and Stephen
    Wozniak. Beginning in 1976, these two entrepreneurs were on a freight train
    of rapid growth until the company became so unwieldy that is almost jumped
    the tracks in 1983. Apple was faced with the leadership crisis of a growth
    company that didn’t have anyone who could efficiently run its day-to-day
    operations. Jobs was a lofty visionary making speeches, while Wozniak was
    the magic technician.</p>
<p>The company started to run out of gas as its creative fuel ran low. Apple
    II sales slumped and the new Lisa computer failed. John Sculley (Wharton
    MBA ’63) was brought in from Pepsi-Cola to give the company direction.
    Sculley reorganized Apple and cut costs in its bloated headquarters. Steve
    Jobs and his followers demanded more autonomy to develop a new breakthrough
    product and Sculley gave it to them. The delegation resulted in the
    creation of the Macintosh.</p>
<p>The Mac created another explosive growth period. However, Jobs could
    not work in a growing corporate bureaucracy, and he started a new company
    called NeXT. In 1989 the aging Mac faced fierce competition, and as profits
    declined in 1990, a new Apple crisis of control was brewing. Michael Spindler
    was appointed as chief operating officer to assist Sculley as chairman to take
    control and return the company to increasing profitability. By 1992 they had
    succeeded, but fell into crisis in 1995. Steve Jobs returned and led yet another
    recovery in 1998 with the iMac and G3 computers.</p>
