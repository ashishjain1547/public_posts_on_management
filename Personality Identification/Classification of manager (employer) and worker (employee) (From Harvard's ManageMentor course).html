<pre>Classification of manager is done based on two vectors:
1. Guides you
2. Directs you

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x_iLCUFKoCE/XnLnlQqq4PI/AAAAAAAAEgs/iY6FMHHqPmQhTTrVq8RErsBtPONsgzCbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="294" data-original-width="424" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x_iLCUFKoCE/XnLnlQqq4PI/AAAAAAAAEgs/iY6FMHHqPmQhTTrVq8RErsBtPONsgzCbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1.jpg" /></a></div>

Based on these two, manager might behave in 4 different ways:
1. High guiding, high directing: Guide
2. Low guiding, high directing: Directive
3. Low guiding, low directing: Entrusting
4. High guiding, low directing: Partner

Caveat: based on how well your manager understands you with time, her behavior might change in terms of her guiding and directing.

Classification of worker is done based on following two vectors:

1. Skill 
2. Will

Based on these two, worker might behave in 4 different ways:

1. High skill, high will: Performer
2. Low skill, high will: Learner
3. Low skill, low will: Underperformer
4. High skill, low will: Demotivated

Three tips on managing up:
1. Bring solutions, not problems
2. Solve your boss's problems
3. One challenge rule

# Handling angry client or boss is best done by asking clarifying questions. Ask for examples.

# People don't leave jobs, they leave bad managers.

# Circle of yelling (a concept showed in the TV show "How I met your mother"). 
Your boss yells at you so you go home and yell at your wife. Your wife is a teacher who yells at her student. That student is the child of your boss so because of being yelled at throws a temper tantrum at home which aggravates your boss who started the circle by yelling at you. It continues to repeat creating the circle.
