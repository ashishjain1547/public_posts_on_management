<pre><b>Overview of Model </b>

The method used by most management training workshops and employers is the ever-popular Merrill-Reid method, which categorizes personality types into 4 as:
 Driver
 Expressive
 Amiable
 Analytical

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SAABd8Nnse0/XnGB3oFwsxI/AAAAAAAAEfU/T34d2HK-fW8jP2psiko8QlncLB8dO_pcwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Capture.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="474" data-original-width="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SAABd8Nnse0/XnGB3oFwsxI/AAAAAAAAEfU/T34d2HK-fW8jP2psiko8QlncLB8dO_pcwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Capture.PNG" /></a></div>

These styles are defined by two behavioral variables or dimensions: assertiveness and responsiveness.

Assertiveness = the degree to which a person's behaviors are seen by others as forceful or directive.

Responsiveness = the degree to which a person's behaviors are seen by others as emotionally controlled. More responsive people react noticeably to their own emotions or to the emotions of others. Less responsive people are more guarded in their emotional expression.

While no one style works better than any other, flexibility has been shown to distinguish the success manager of conflict from the unsuccessful.

Flexibility = the ability to get along with people whose styles differ from one's own.

<b>Comparison with Other Methods: </b>
2 of the 3 Jung Typologies are same with this method, Extroversion-Introversion (E-I) and Thinking-Feeling (T-F) vectors. Jung Typology Tests differ in one vector (Sensing-Intuition, S-N) and Myers Briggs differs with another vector Judging-Perceiving (J-P).

Studies from Jung Typologies:

Extroversion-Introversion (E-I)
Extroversion-Introversion (E-I) is the most important scale. The developers of Jung personality test have calculated that about one third of the population is extroverted. You may be extrovert when you concentrate on people and the environment around you. However, you are considered introvert when you focus on your thoughts and ideas.

Sensing-Intuiting (S-N)
Sensing – Intuiting (S-N) is the next scale denoted. In it about 75 % of the population belongs to sensing.

Thinking-Feeling (T-F)
Thinking - Feeling is the third scale represented by (T-F). These are dispersed evenly through the population, as two-thirds of men are thinkers, while two-thirds of women are feelers.

--- --- --- ---

DISC test uses the same vectors and is very close to this approach. It only differs by creating a sub-category.

The 4 personality types approach creates a foundation for further self analysis and provides the basic framework for understanding one’s self.

APPLICATIONS

Step 1: Self-Evaluation - With a 15 minute survey (15 questions) we can map the selfperception of a person and categorize primary strengths and weaknesses.

Step 2: Cross Check Self Evaluation - With additional cross-checking test (word selections) we can test the self perception and reliability of the self-evaluation.

Step 3: 360 Tests for Comparisons - With 360 tests we can test self-awareness (are you aware how others perceive you?) and determine your gaps between self-perception and actual behaviors.

Step 4: One-on-one coaching sessions – Personal Strategic Planning. Indentifying personal mission statement, vision, goals, values, strengths, talents, passions, role models through oneon-one discussions.

<b>The Analytical </b>
The Analytical is polite but reserved, logical, fact- and task-oriented. This person’s focus is on precision and perfection. Other strengths include persistence, diligence, caution, and a systematic approach. Weaknesses involve being withdrawn, boring, quiet, reclusive, and even
sullen at times. If he or she seems indecisive, it’s because of a need to assess all the data. Perfectionism can be a fault if the Analytical pushes it too far. This person is definitely not a risk-taker. The Analytical needs to be right, and won’t openly discuss ideas until confident in a decision. His or her pleasure is accuracy. Pain is to be wrong and criticized.

When communicating with an Analytical:
 Be systematic, thorough, deliberate, and precise
 Focus on the task
 Be prepared to answer many “how” questions
 Provide analysis and facts
 Don’t get too personal
 Recognize and acknowledge the need to be accurate and logical
 Don’t rush unnecessarily
 Expect to repeat yourself
 Allow time for evaluation
 Use lots of evidence
 Compliment the precision and accuracy of the completed work.

<b>Portrait of an Analytical’s office </b>
The first thing you notice will probably be the glasses. The Analytical will have worn out his or her eyes from constantly reading everything. On the wall you may see a framed degree, but the chief decoration will be charts, figures, and graphs of every kind. The analytical is not very friendly, will often greet you skeptically, and doesn’t want to share much – especially anything personal. There will be no flowers or plant; for the Analytical, they belong in greenhouses. On the desk will be only business-related information, and that will be carefully arranged. It’s not a power office, but it definitely will be functional. As for color, black and white will do nicely.
Symbol: Owl.

<b>The Amiable </b>
Devoted, consistent, dependable, and loyal, the Amiable is a hard worker and will persevere long after others have given up. He or she is a team player, cooperative and easy to get along with, trustful, sensitive and a good listener. Working in groups with cooperative individuals, the Amiable tries to avoid confrontation. He or she enjoys company, performs best in a stable environment, and often has a stabilizing effect on others. Weaknesses include indecision and an inability to take risks. Amiables are often too focused on others, conforming, quiet, and passive. They often won’t speak up for themselves, are too compliant and nice, and often painstakingly slow to make decisions. The Amiable’s pleasure is stability and cooperation. His or her pain is change and chaos. 

When communication with an Amiable:
 Be relaxed and agreeable
 Maintain the status quo
 Be logical and systematic
 Create a plan with written guidelines
 Be prepared to answer “why” questions
 Be predictable
 Agree clearly and often
 Use the word “we”
 Don’t push
 Don’t rush
 Compliment him or her as a team player
 Be a good listener

<b>Portrait of an Amiable’s office </b>

The first thing you will notice will be pictures of loved ones on the desk: husband, wife, family, favorite pets. They’ll be in a candid style, and the Amiable loves to talk about them. On the walls will be colorful photos of landscapes, waterfalls, birds, and sunsets. You’ll find flowers or plants that are growing well and office colors that are harmonious and restful. The person will almost certainly be dressed in colors that match. Furniture will be fashionable, but not overwhelming. Files are present, but usually kept out of the way. If you’re a little late, the Amiable won’t mind. If you have the Amiable in your company, he or she will stay with you. The Amiable likes company, newsletters, picnics, gatherings, and retirement parties.
Symbol: Dove.

<b>The Driver </b>

The Driver is a high achiever – a mover and shaker who is definitely not averse to risk. The individual is extroverted, strong-willed, direct, practical, organized, forceful, and decisive. Look for someone who tells it the way it is and is very persuasive. Watch out or you’ll be worn down and bowled over. A driver is task- rather than relationship-oriented and wants immediate results. This individual is not concerned with how something is done, but what is being done, and what results can be expected. “What” is his or her battle cry. “What’s going on? What’s being done about it? What you should do is ...!” The Driver can be stubborn, domineering, impatient, insensitive, and shorttempered, with little time for formalities or niceties. He or she can also be demanding, opinionated, controlling, and uncompromising – or even overbearing, cold, and harsh. The Driver’s pleasure is power, control, and respect. His or her pain is loss of respect, lack of results, and the feeling that he or she is being taken advantage of.

<b>When communicating with a Driver </b>
 Focus on the task
 Talk about expected results
 Be businesslike and factual
 Provide concise, precise, and organized information
 Discuss and answer “what” questions
 Argue facts, not feelings
 Don’t waste time
 Don’t argue details
 Provide options.

<b>Portrait of a Driver’s office </b>
Of course, it must be the corner office with two windows, but the Driver never looks at the view. Pictures on the wall are of battlefields, maps, and boats. The Driver is a multi-tasked person and can sign letters, hold interviews, and talk on the phone simultaneously. Office furniture contributes to the impression of power and control, and is the most expensive and incredible available. The office may also contain flowers and plants, even exotic ones like orchids (carefully chose to contribute to the impression of power), but the Driver never looks after them. There’s an assistant to do that. On the desk are often family portraits, but never candid shots. They are formal portraits showing everyone in his or her proper role, frozen forever as the Driver sees them. The office will probably be decorated by an interior designer to create the feeling of power, and the colors of the office will be strong power colors. Curt and tough, straight to business. That’s the Driver at work in his or her den. Don’t waste time. Get straight to the point!
Symbol: Eagle.

<b>The Expressive </b>
The Expressive, a verbally adept personality, is engaging, accommodating, supportive of others, persuasive, socially adept, and relationship- rather than task-oriented. He or she loves to be one of the gang, and is always ready for something new and exciting, especially if the gang is ready to participate. Additional strengths include enthusiasm, diplomatic skills, and the ability to inspire others. Weaknesses involve impatience, a tendency to generalize, verbal assaults, and sometimes irrational behavior. The Expressive can also be egotistical, manipulative, undisciplined, reactive, unorganized, and abrasive. The Expressive readily exchanges information and life experiences. His or her main need is to be appreciated and accepted. The Expressive’s pleasure is recognition and approval. His or her pain is isolation and lack of attention.

When communicating with an Expressive:

 Focus on developing a relationship
 Try to show how your ideas will improve his or her image
 Be enthusiastic, open, and responsive
 Relate to the need to share information, stories, and experience
 Be forthcoming and willing to talk
 Ask and answer “who” questions
 Remember to be warm and approachable at all times
 Work to minimize his or her direct involvement with details or personal conflicts.

<b>Portrait of an Expressive’s office </b>
In short, it’s a mess. The Expressive loves favorite sayings and has them plastered on the wall or sitting on the desk. Files are never in a filing cabinet. Rather, they’re piled all over the office in stacks. But don’t be misled. The Expressive knows exactly where everything is and can find virtually anything by its location. Office colors will probably be loud and lively. If there are flowers or plants, they’re likely dead – either talked to death or lacking water. The Expressive’s greatest reward is personal acknowledgment from others, and examples of this will be displayed. The Expressive is an excitable dreamer, with lots of ideas and projects, but without the time to follow.
