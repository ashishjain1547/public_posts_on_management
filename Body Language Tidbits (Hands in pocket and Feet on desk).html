<pre>Here are some body languages and psychological tricks that you might find interesting:

1. The feet don't lie: When you approach a person or group of people, try to notice if they turn their feet's towards you. If they do, then you're welcome. If they don't, well, keep moving Bob.

2. The Ask: If you want somebody to like you, ask them for a favor; it can be as little as borrowing a pen or asking for the time. They will feel that they have made an investment in you, and hence, they'll be more open to you.

3. The Nod: When you nod your head while speaking, you tend to encourage the other person listening to mirror the gesture and agree with what your saying.

4. The Laugh: When you're in a group of people and someone says something funny and everybody starts laughing, try to notice who's looking at you while laughing. People tend to look at the person they feel closest to when they laugh.

5. The Shoes: When in a public place, if someone keeps looking at you so much it’s becoming frustrating, just look at their shoes... like, for a long time; this will make them feel so uncomfortable, they'll probably back off.

Some amazing psychological facts:

1. Meditation can change brain structure in just 8 weeks . It also increases grey matter in parts of the brain associated with learning.

2. Psychology says, The people who you treasure the most often cause you the greatest pain.

3. You change for two reasons. Either you learn enough that you want to or you’ve been hurt enough that you have to.

4. When someone gives you any suggestion or advice, respond by saying “ you're right” rather than saying “ I know”. You'll sound nicer and diplomatic.
Sometimes the eyes can say more than mouth.

Reading body language: <b>Hands in pocket </b>

According to body language when someone becomes unsatisfied with his self image he will put his hands in his pockets. Suppose that one day you didn’t find any clothes to wear and had to hang out with your friends wearing an old shirt that doesn’t suit you anymore.

If a stranger accompanied you in this outing then most probably you will find that your hand is in your pocket most of the time. Generally people put their hands in pocket when they are feel unsatisfied with their looks, clothes or their actions.

But why do people put their hands in their pockets?
The subconscious mind, which thinks in a primitive way, believes that putting your hands in your pockets is a good way to hide and to avoid the situation.

Putting the hands in pocket is sometimes associated with lying but beware not to consider someone a liar just because his hands is in his pocket. You need more signs in order to confirm whether someone is lying or not (For more information see how to read a liar’s body language).

The concept is the same for lying, the person feels in need to hide because he is not saying the truth but this only happens when the person thinks that lying is bad.

If someone always puts his hands in his pockets then this person might be lacking self confidence because he always feels uncomfortable around other people.

<i>Use your mind </i>
It makes a lot of sense to use your mind before judging people so that you don't get incorrect results. Sometimes a person might put his hands in his pocket because he feels cold.

Keep your eyes opened for the other variables involved while analyzing the body language of the people you are talking to.

Its also extremely to analyze the gesture in the context of the situation. For example if a person moved his hands inside his pockets after being asked a certain question then make sure that this new gesture was a response to this question he was just asked.

In short, use your mind in order to get accurate readings.

Reading body language: <b>Feet on the desk </b>

"It is the symbolic meaning of a posture," Park says, "rather than the posture itself, that influences the psychological experiences of individuals from different cultures," says Lora Park.

Study 3 found that the expansive-feet-on-desk pose led to greater feelings of power and implicit activation of power-related concepts for Americans, but not for East Asians.

Study 4 found that compared to a constricted posture, the expansive feet-on-desk pose led to greater risk-taking among Americans, but not among East Asians. Specifically, after holding the posture for three minutes, American participants were more likely to choose to take action to deal with a problem or situation presented to them, whereas this posture did not have the same effect on East Asian participants.
