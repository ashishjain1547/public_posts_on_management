    The performance of CEOs of investee companies, which we have observed at close range, contrasts vividly with that
    of many CEOs, which we have fortunately observed from a safe distance. Sometimes these CEOs clearly do not belong
    in their jobs; their positions, nevertheless, are usually secure. The supreme irony of business management in that
    it is far easier for an inadequate CEO to keep his job than it is for an inadequate subordinate.<br />
    <br />
    If a secretary, say, is hired for a job that requires typing ability of at least 80 words a minute and turns out to
    be capable of only 50 words a minute, she will lose her job in no time. There is a logical standard for this job;
    performance is easily measured; and if you can't make the grade, you're out. Similarly, if new sales people fail to
    generate sufficient business quickly enough, they will be let go. Excuses will not be accepted as a substitute for
    orders.<br />
    <br />
    However, a CEO who doesn't perform is frequently carried indefinitely. One reason is that performance standards for
    his job seldom exist. When they do, they are often fuzzy or they may be waived or explained away, even when the
    performance shortfalls are major and repeated. At too many companies, the boss shoots the arrow of managerial
    performance and then hastily paints the bullseye around the spot where it lands.<br />
    <br />
    Another important, but seldom recognized, distinction between the boss and the foot soldier is that the CEO has no
    immediate superior whose performance is itself getting measured. The sales manager who retains a bunch of lemons in
    his sales force will soon be in hot water himself. It is in his immediate self-interest to promptly weed out his
    hiring mistakes. Otherwise, he himself may be weeded out. An office manager who has hired inept secretaries faces
    the same imperative.<br />
    <br />
    But the CEO's boss is a Board of Directors that seldom measures itself and is infrequently held to account for
    substandard corporate performance. If the Board makes a mistake in hiring, and perpetuates that mistake, so what?
    Even if the company is taken over because of the mistake, the deal will probably bestow substantial benefits on the
    outgoing Board members. (The bigger they are, the softer they fall.)<br />
    <br />
    Finally, relations between the Board and the CEO are expected to be congenial. At board meetings, criticism of the
    CEO's performance is often viewed as the social equivalent of belching. No such inhibitions restrain the office
    manager from critically evaluating the substandard typist.<br />
    <br />
    These points should not be interpreted as a blanket condemnation of CEOs or Boards of Directors: Most are able and
    hardworking, and a number are truly outstanding. But the management failings that Charlie and I have seen make us
    thankful that we are linked with the managers of our three permanent holdings. They love their businesses, they
    think like owners, and they exude integrity and ability.<br />
