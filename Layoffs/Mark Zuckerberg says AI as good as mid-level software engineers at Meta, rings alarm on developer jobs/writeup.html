<b>In Short</b>

# He says AI at Meta and other tech companies could effectively replace mid-level engineers

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has raised fresh concerns about the future of developer jobs, revealing that artificial intelligence (AI) at Meta is already reaching the capabilities of mid-level software engineers. During a podcast with YouTuber Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg shared his vision for the role of AI in coding and the potential disruption it poses to the job market.

He stated that by 2025, AI at Meta and other tech companies could effectively replace mid-level engineers who currently write code. This would represent a big shift in how tech companies approach software development.

"We will get to a point where all the code in our apps and the AI it generates will also be written by AI engineers instead of people engineers," he said. For context, Business Insider reported that mid-level software engineers at Meta currently earn salaries in the mid-six figures â€” a cost AI could significantly reduce.

Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when other tech giants, such as Google and IBM, are also integrating AI into their operations, raising similar alarms. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, recently announced that over 25 per cent of all new code at Google is now generated by AI, with human engineers stepping in for final reviews. Meanwhile, IBM’s CEO, Arvind Krishna, revealed in 2023 that AI could replace up to 30 per cent of the company’s back-office roles. The trend, seen across different sectors, is sparking a debate about the future of traditional coding jobs.

<b>Jobs of human engineers are at risk?</b>

Zuckerberg’s latest announcement and Google's recent remark on AI completing coding tasks suggest that the role of human engineers is changing, potentially leading to fewer coding jobs in the traditional sense. Rather than spending time on routine tasks, engineers may need to focus on higher-level problem-solving and oversight of AI-generated code. As AI is more integrated into tech workflows, junior and entry-level coding positions might diminish, forcing aspiring developers to rethink their career paths.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom for engineers. AI’s growing role in code generation could actually empower coders to concentrate on more strategic and creative aspects of development. It is important to note that human engineers can't be replaced in the longer run because they can solve complex issues that AI alone cannot handle. As routine tasks are increasingly automated, the importance of these core competencies will grow, placing greater value on skills that complement AI.

<b>This tech company has stopped hiring humans</b>

Meta isn’t alone in its AI journey. Klarna, a leading fintech company, has also supported AI-driven automation, reducing its workforce by 20 per cent over the past year without hiring replacements. Klarna’s CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, has openly stated that AI now performs nearly all tasks traditionally handled by human employees, signaling yet another shift toward an AI-dominated future.

The company, which previously had 4,500 employees, now has 3,500. This reduction happened naturally, according to the CEO, due to the 20 per cent annual attrition rate common in tech firms.
