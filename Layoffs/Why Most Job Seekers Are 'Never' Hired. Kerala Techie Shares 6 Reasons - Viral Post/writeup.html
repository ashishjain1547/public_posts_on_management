<pre>It has been observed that many job seekers find it difficult to get a job or get through job applications. After getting stuck in a cycle of job applications and rejections, they are not able to figure out what went wrong. However, this one post is going viral on social media, which tells social media what could be the possible reasons that 'most of the job seekers are never hired.'

The post was shared by a Kerala-based techie who shared six reasons that ''why most of job seekers are not able to get jobs.'' He also elaborated on the mistakes that professionals should avoid making. His post based on the personal experiences in job hunting and mentoring candidates, Abhishek Nair listed key mistakes that prevent job seekers from breaking into the industry in X post.

Nair said in his post, ''A recruiter friend of mine recently revealed why 90% of job seekers never get hired. Recently, over a casual chai meet, one such recruiter friend - who manages hiring for a lean travel tech startup - shared the 6 biggest reasons why most job seekers never get hired.''

In his conversation, he compiled the list of reasons explaining why job seekers are missing out on opportunities and how can they be avoided.

<h2>The Key Reasons</h2>

(1) Zero Practical Experience - 

''In today's world, where it's easier than ever to build websites and projects, if your resume or portfolio lacks solid projects, you don't deserve a job. You don't need to build the next Facebook or Twitter — but a calculator app won't cut it either. Build decent projects that push your limits while showcasing your skills at the same time!''

(2) Applying Blindly - 

''Spraying your resume to every job listing on LinkedIn isn't a job search strategy — it's desperation. Most recruiters can smell a mass application from a mile away. Apply to fewer jobs, but customize your resume and cover letter to show you're genuinely interested in that company and that role.''

(3) Zero Personal Brand - 

''If your only presence online is a private Instagram account and a LinkedIn profile with 12 connections — you're invisible to recruiters. The easiest way to stand out is to show your work publicly. Write about what you're learning, share your projects, or just document your journey — even if you're a beginner.''

(4) No Networking - 

''Game Most jobs aren't found on job boards — they're found through people. If you're not building relationships with devs, recruiters, or hiring managers on X, LinkedIn, or Discord communities, you're making your job search 10x harder. Your first 10 DMs will probably get ignored — but that 11th DM could change your career.''

(5) Resume Full of Buzzwords - 

"Hardworking, self-motivated team player with a passion for technology" Cool. So is everyone else. Instead of stuffing your resume with generic adjectives, focus on: What problems you've solved, What tools you used, What impact you made. Let your work speak louder than the buzzwords.''

(6) Waiting for the "Perfect Job" - 

"I'll apply once I learn one more framework." "I'll start networking once I finish my portfolio." "I'll post on LinkedIn once I know more." Bro... Nobody is coming to save you. Start with whatever you have, however imperfect it is. The best opportunities come to those who are already in motion — not those waiting to be ready.''

The post has since gone viral and garnered over 20 thousand views. Many netizens have applauded the post for deep insights.
